# dotfiles
Various startup/configuration files for personal account(s)

Once a user account has been set up, clone this repo into, for example,
`$HOME/Code/dotfiles`. 

Then `cd $HOME/Code/dotfiles` and run `etc/deploy.sh` to deploy the 
dotfile corresponding to the shell of the current user. This will create the
`~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` or whatever.

I don't have a good plan for things like `vim` dotfiles yet. More to come.
